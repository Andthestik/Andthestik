# AI Video-to-Blog MicroSaaS Plan

## Market Research and Opportunity
- **Problem**: Video creators struggle to repurpose long-form video content into written formats like blogs, newsletters, and social posts.

  - Automatic transcription ingestion (from YouTube or uploaded files).
  - AI summarization tuned for long-form educational or marketing videos.
  - Output as blog posts, email newsletters, and social media snippets.
